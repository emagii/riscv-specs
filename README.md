This is a dummy repository to track issues with the specification until the official RISC-V specs move to GitHub.

I want editorial issues and issues that need to be addressed prior to priv-2.0.  Proposals for optional extensions are out of scope here unless a credible case can be made that _not_ specifying them would create a compatibility risk.
