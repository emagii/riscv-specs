This is a dummy repository to track issues with the specification until the official RISC-V specs move to GitHub.

I'm inspired by https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs and I'd like to move more in that direction.  But I'm just one person, not a subteam, so not all the process will be implemented.

We could have a very rushed 2.0 and a 3.0 sometime before CY2020, but I'd rather we be a little more methodical about it.  So this repository will focus on issues that need to be resolved or clearly roadmapped for an awesome 2.0, in particular the following scopes:

* Strictly editorial issues

* Features for which, what people will do if the feature is missing, is dramatically less compatible than the feature itself would be

* Things that, if frozen in 2.0, are likely to be regarded as "baggage"

* Things that take far too much of their fair share of the weirdness budget

* Actual implementation problems, reported by people doing actual implementations

Features or changes which can be done compatibly later, especially those which require a large amount of discussion like transactional memory, are probably best suited for another forum.  We'll see.

Please keep discussion focused on the specific issue for any given thread.  *Offtopic comments will be deleted.*
